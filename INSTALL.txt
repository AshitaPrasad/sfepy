This is not for faint of the heart!

Installation prerequisites:
    latest (SVN) numpy, scipy (with umfpack support), swig

Dependencies:
    matplotlib, pyparsing, umfpack, pytables
    eigen.py can use symeig

Not tested on Windows, I don't have them.

Compiling:
----------
1. Edit the Makefile.
  - compiler, swig command
  - location of python and numpy include files
2. 'make'

Installation:
-------------
None. Run the executable script 'simple.py' in the top-level directory of the
distribution (TOPDIR).

Testing:
--------

Run './runTests.py --filter' or './runTests.py --filter-more' in TOPDIR.

Tests that save results save them into TOPDIR/output-tests directory. View the
results (*.vtk) with a VTK-capable viewer (e.g. paraview, mayavi2).

If all is ok, four failed tests (of 20) should be reported. The failed tests
cover code not included in the distribution; they are:
test_input_pfdpm_permeability.py, test_input_stabilized_navier_stokes.py and
test_boundaryFluxes() of test_laplace_unit_disk.py,
test_laplace_unit_square.py.

If you get more failures, be sure to verify that you have the latest SVN
version of Numpy and SciPy installed (should be at least '0.7.0.dev3649' for
SciPy and '1.0.5.dev4571' for NumPy).
Verify also your pytables installation (possible test_io.py failures).
