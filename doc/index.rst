Welcome to SfePy's documentation!
=================================

SfePy is a finite element analysis software written almost entirely in Python.

SfePy can use many terms to build systems of partial differential
equations (PDEs) to be solved - follow this quick link to the table of
all available terms to see the full list: :ref:`term_overview`. SfePy
comes with a number of examples that can get you started, check
:ref:`examples`. Some more advanced features are discussed in :doc:`primer`.

Applications
------------

- homogenization of porous media (parallel flows in a deformable porous
  medium)
- acoustic band gaps (homogenization of a strongly heterogenous
  elastic structure: phononic materials)
- acoustic waves in thin perforated layers
- shape optimization in incompressible flow problems
- finite element formulation of Schroedinger equation
