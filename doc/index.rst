   SfePy: simple finite elements in Python
   =======================================

   SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential
   equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 2D and 3D. It can be viewed
   both as black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package which can be used for
   building custom applications. The word "simple" means that complex FEM
   problems can be coded very easily and rapidly.

   SfePy can use many terms to build systems of partial differential
   equations (PDEs) to be solved - follow this quick link to the table of
   all available terms to see the full list: :ref:`term_overview`. SfePy
   comes with a number of examples that can get you started, check
   :ref:`examples`. Some more advanced features are discussed in :doc:`primer`.

   Applications
   ------------

   Here we list some of the applications SfePy is developed for.

   - homogenization of porous media (parallel flows in a deformable porous
     medium)
   - acoustic band gaps (homogenization of a strongly heterogenous
     elastic structure: phononic materials)
   - acoustic waves in thin perforated layers
   - shape optimization in incompressible flow problems
   - finite element formulation of Schroedinger equation
