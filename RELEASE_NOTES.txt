from 00.31.06 to 00.35.01:
==========================
- per term integration, major rewrite of sfe.fem and related:
    - term.integral.domain( arguments ) syntax
    - 'integral_*' keyword for input files
    - each term can use its own quadrature points
    - 'field' keyword syntax changed

- minor:
    - genDocs.py: PDF term documentation generator

from 00.26.01 to 00.31.06:
==========================

- acoustic band gaps determination:
    - zones of frequencies where elastic waves do not prapagate
    - based on homogenization of material made of small inclusions periodically
    embedded in an elastic matrix
    - run via 'eigen.py'
- general linear combination boundary conditions - 'lcbc' keyword:
    - rigid body motion constraint imposed on regions
- new Solver classes, solver reorganization:
    - all solvers now configured in a uniform way ('solver_[0-9]+' keywords)
    - specify solvers using 'options' keyword
- new terms:
    - dot product in a volume or on a surface region
    - vector field mass term
    - scalar field "mass", fine-coarse scalar "mass" terms:
        - used for coarse mesh -> fine mesh interpolation of scalar fields

- minor:
    - added updated findSurf.py into distribution - extract surface from a mesh
    - script/kill_*
    - script/writeMesh2D.m
    - script/writeSparseMatrixHDF5.m

from 00.22.02 to 00.26.01:
==========================

- testing framework (in the spirit of unit tests):
    - particularly tests that standard input files work
    - runTests.py: output filtering
- linear spring term (kind of a relaxed Dirichlet BC on node displacements)
- volume term
- Laplace term in 2D
- chained periodic boundary conditions resolving
- new options for simple.py: --save-field-meshes, --solve-not
- periodic mesh merger (genPerMesh.py)

- minor:
    - improved region saving
    - growing term data cache
    - sparse matrix saving into HDF5
    - point dof connectivity and geometry
    - region handling improvements (canCells flag)
    - nonlinear solver status reporting
    - distribution: test and example meshes included in the release tarball
